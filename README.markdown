Stable Master Policy
===============
The master branch will at all times remain stable.  Development for new features will occur in branches and when ready, will be pulled into the master branch.

In the event features have already been merged for the next release series and an issue arises that warrants a fix on the current release series, the developer will create a branch based off the tag created from the previous release, make the necessary changes, package a new release, and tag the new release.  If necessary, the commits made in the temporary branch will be merged into master.
